PRACTICAL 6
Aim :- Develop an IoT asset tracking app using Block chain. Use an IoT asset tracking device to
improve a supply chain by using Block chain, IoT devices, and Node-RED


#Import the sample perishable network into Hyperledger Composer Playground

=> 1. Access the IBM Hyperledger Composer Playground.
=> 2. Click on Deploy a new business network
=> 3. Scroll down and choose perishable-network from the samples on npm.
=> 4. Scrolling back to the top, you should now have a business network name of xxx-perishable-network.

#Note: The unique identifier becomes very important later on in this code pattern because this business
network name is used to create a rest server on the IBM Cloud. If the name is not unique then it will fail
during the build process.

=> 5. Give the network admin card that will be created a name admin@xxx-perishable-network.


###Node-RED - IoT Asset Tracker Introduction


-> Create an account and log into IBM Cloud
-> Click on the Catalog 
(1) and search for 'internet of things' 
(2) The Internet of Things Platform Starter you can see in result
(3) click on that and now set the App name but make it unique with using (ex. IoTAssetTracker-ravi)
(4) then click on create button
(5) now wait for status to show green color after that visit the URL
(6) now in new tab open node_red by writing in cmd (=> node node-red) in linux cmd (node-red)
(7) now in that install additional node red nodes for that
(8) click on menu then click manage palette
(9) then go to install 
(10) inside that search for node-red-dashboard
(11) now install it.

(12) now again go to menu 
(13) click on import button
(14) click clipboard
(15) now in import node paste this : - code from git repo link 
=> https://github.com/johnwalicki/IoT-AssetTracking-Perishable-Network-Blockchain/blob/master/Node-RED/flows/IoTAssetTracker-AllFlows.json

(17) after paste just click on import button

###Initialize the Perishable Blockchain / Node-RED flow

Now I dont from here.
