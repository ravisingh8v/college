Q.1: Exploring and building a varification lab for  penetration testing (Kali linux)

Steps:- 
1. install virtual box or vmware workstation from official site.
2. during installation set RAM atleast 1 or 2 gb and storage atleast 15gb
3. now in our main "windows" system go to following path
   c:\program files\oracle\virtualbox\ or if you using vmware workstation then go C:\program files\vmWARE\vmware player\
and open cmd and enter this :

=> VBoxManage natnetwork add --netname InsideNetwork --network "10.10.10.0/24" –-enable --dhcp on 

4. Install windows server 2016 in window os from
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluatewindows-server-2016-essentials

   with that we can perform below steps :

5. Ensure network adaptor is connected to the right network.
6. now open VMBox and click on virtual machine and click on settings.
7. then from the menu, click on network -enable network in checked.

8. login to windows server 2016
9. after that open cmd line and write following command:
   netsh interface ip set address "ethernet" static 10.10.10.100 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1
10.From server manager click on Add roles and features
11.select role base or featurebased installation and click next
12.then select server keep it selected default one and go next
13.from server roles page, place a checkmark in the checkbox next to active Directory domain services. additionaly roles, services, or features are also required to install Domain services : click add features and click on Next.
14.Select optional  features to install during the AD DS installation by placing a checkk in the box next to any desired features, and click on next.
15.that should take us to the confirmation screen with all the selected features and services; click on install and when the installation is completed click on close
16.select ad ds; it should come up with a warning starting: configuration required for active directory domain services. now click on more for post-deployment configuration
17.click on Promote this server to domain controler.
18.select add new forest and enter the fully qualified Domain name (FQDN). in this example, we will create a new FQDN called mastering.cali.fourthedition. then click Next
19. On the next screen, for both Forest functional level and Domain functional level, select Windows 
Server 2016 and type the password for Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM); click Next
20. Do not select the DNS delegation—directly click on Next, where it should pick up the NetBIOS 
domain name as MASTERING. Click Next
21. Select the locations for the database, log files, and SYSVOL for Active Directory, and finally, you 
should be presented with a review screen, as shown in Figure; click Next:
22. All the prerequisites must be met. Ignore the warnings; after this, click on Install. 
23. On the Confirm installation selections screen, review the installation and then click Install. Doing 
so should reboot the system and a newActive Directory server with a domain controller should have 
been established.

To create a normal user on the domain, run the following command in the command line on the 
domain controller:
#In windows server 2016 
=>net user normaluser Passw0rd12 /add /domain 
=>net user admin Passw0rd123 /add /domain 
=>net group "domain admins" admin /add /domain

=>net user exchangeadmin Passw0rd123 /add /domain 
=>net group "domain admins" exchangeadmin /add /domain 
=>net group "Schema admins" exchangeadmin /add /domain 
=>net group "Enterprise admins" exchangeadmin /add /domain 

##Metasploit 2
Download Metasploitable from below mentioned link
https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/ 


1.Once you have downloaded the file from the above link. Extract the file. This is a very curial step 
otherwise the file will not be uploaded in the VM. 

2.Once you click on New option, you will have to Name. In this case I put the name as 
“Metaexploitable”, Type: Linux and 
change Version: Other Linux (64-bit) and click on Next. 

3. Create a virtual hard disk 

set id and password
