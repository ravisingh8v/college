Q.1 Use of open-source intelligence and passive reconnaissance

1. Gather Domain Information

Install Sublist3r

=> sudo apt install sublist3r

if its not work you have to install it manually
=> git clone https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git
=> cd Sublist3r
=> sudo apt install python-pip
=> sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
=> python3 sublist3r.py -h

output ***

2.OSRframework

Go to root directory then 

#usufy
=> pip install osrfamework --user
=> sudo usufy.py -n aliabhatt

if its not work you have to install it manually

=> git clone git clone https://github.com/i3visio/osrframework.git
=> cd osrframework
=> sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
=> python3 usufy.py -n aliabhatt


output: ***
then open any link in browser

#malify

=> sudo mailfy -n cyberhia

output: **

#searchfy

=> sudo searchfy -q "cyberhia"

output: **

3.Web archives
When something is deleted from the internet, it is not necessarily completely deleted from 
everywhere. Every page that is visited by Google is backed up as a snapshot in Google’s cache 
servers

 - go to https://web.archive.org/web/
 - search for cyberhia.com
 - then see the screenshot for any specific date or time

4.Scrapping

a) gather username and email addresses

=> sudo theHarvester -d facebook.com -l 100 -b google

 (if not work)
[
    => git clone https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester.git
    => cd theHarvester
    => sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    => python3 theHarvester.py -d example.com -l 100 -b google

]

this find the subdomain email address and username for popular Domain

b) Obtaining user Information
Many penetration testers gather usernames and email addresses, as this information is frequently 
used to log on to targeted systems. The most commonly employed tool is the web browser, which is 
used to manually search the target organization’s website as well as third-party sites, such as 
LinkedIn or other social networking websites. 

  - GO to tineye.com 
  - search for any person or anything just by dragging drop the image or putting image url

c) Online Search portals
Shodan is one of the most important search engines available, as it lets anyone on the internet find 
devices connected to the internet using a variety of filters. It can be accessed by visiting 
https://www.shodan.io/

 - go to following link and Search anything
 - you can find all the related info about your system

d) Censys
Attackers can also utilize the censys.io API for relevant information gathering; this can provide more 
information about IPv4 hosts, websites, certifications, and other stored information. Information 
about cyberhia.com: 

e) SpiderFoot
=> spiderfoot -l 10.0.2.15:8009

output: ***

- it will give the site link go to that link
- click on setting and add all the API keys that you might already have; an example, the AbusIPDB.com API key (you can create this 
key by visiting abuseIPDB) is added to SpiderFoot, as shown in Figure; then save the changes. This 
can similarly be done for all the APIs that require tokens or API keys:
- click on New Scan
- type the scan name and the seed target, which is our target organization’s primary domain, and select the options
- now The archive of the OSINT performed using SpiderFoot could be accessed by clicking on the Scans tab, 
which will provide all of the past and current running scans

5. Google hacking database

a) Data dump sites
- Any information can be shared online quickly and more effectively with the birth of apps such as 
pastebin.com.

- paste the url and if aksing for login just login to their site

b) defensive OSINT
Defensive OSINT is typically used to see what is already on the internet, including breached 
information; it is also used to see whether that information is valuable during penetration testing. 
Defensive OSINT is largely divided into three places of search.


# Dark web 
The dark web is the encrypted network that exists between Tor servers and their clients, whereas 
the deep web is simply the content of databases and other web services that for one reason or 
another cannot be indexed by conventional search engines, such as Google. 

Let’s take an example of 
- expired drugs or banned drugs that can be sold on the dark web. 
- We will explore how to identify information on the dark web using the Tor browser. Some websites, such as https://dark.fail/, 
provide a market list of hidden deep web links. 


# Security breaches 
A security breach is any incident that results in unauthorized access to data, applications, services, 
networks, and/or devices, by bypassing their underlying security mechanisms. 

- Hackers are known to visit the following websites: 
- https://haveibeenpwned.com 
- https://haveibeenzuckered.com/ 
These websites contain an archive of breached data. 

The following screenshot provides information about whether your email ID was breached as part of 
the recent Facebook breach: https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4?r=US&IR=T: 

#To harvest more information about a target, pentesters can look into websites such as zone-h.com, 
which provide information about breaches. 

For example, a defacement of chinaseeds.com was 
performed by a threat actor group named Moroccohackteam. 

### Public records 
Public records can be utilized to form a password list based on the information that is available to 
profile an individual. One such example is a public record of individuals, such as FindMyPast 

### Profiling users for password lists 
Common User Password Profiler (CUPP) allows the pentester to generate a wordlist that is specific 
to a particular user. 
 
=> sudo apt install cupp 
=> cupp –i 

This will launch CUPP in interactive mode, which prompts the user for specific elements of 
information to use in creating wordlists
